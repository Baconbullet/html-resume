    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>I really love to take pictures. At one point I thought that becoming a photographer was going to be the job I would purse in the future. Of course, many things got in the way and I
        ended up going for a life in software development. I still did a lot with photography as I was getting my degree in Multimedia Design and Communication. I was able to head shots for
        the entire school, students, teachers, and staff. I was also able to do many projects that required photography as a skill. In the end though, I take it as a hobby now and am happy
        every time I get the chance to take my camera out and be creative. Below is a sample picture I took while walking through the night in Denmark when the temperature had reached below 0 degrees:

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>One other hobby that I can name off the top of my head is writing. When I was in middle school, I think it was fair to say that my writing level was far below average. It was actually quite embarrassing.
        I remember having to write a short story for my eighth year, and it was then that I decided that I wanted to take my writing to the next level simply because I had an idea for a story that I knew I needed better
        writing skills to write. I never ended up finishing my short story before the due date. My excuse to my teacher back then was that I wasn't done with it. Fast foward 10 years and multiple rewrites, and I finally
        finished my first novel. I plan to make it a series, though, I still don't know if I will ever consider publishing it. It's just something that I know when I read it, I will enjoy it, because the story is written
        in a way that I know I will love it every single time. This time, I won't be giving any preview to that, though, maybe in the future I will update this linking to some writing of mine...
