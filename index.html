    <h2>A little about me:</h2>
    <p>I am a hard working, challenge driven person. My mind set drives me to be the best at what someone asks of me and I am always putting 110% into whatever task is handed to me.
    I graduated from an academy in Denmark where the focus was on front end development and the process on how to start and grow a business as well as maintaining existing businesses. 
    I have been self teaching for a deeper understanding in front end development since I graduated. I am now taking a full-stack development bootcamp course through Udemy that I hope puts the final
    pieces together for me to be able to apply to any job without worry, fully knowing I will be able to satisfy anyone interviewing me.
